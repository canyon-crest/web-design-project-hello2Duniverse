# 🌐 Unit 7 Project: HTML/CSS Personal Website

## 🎯 Project Objective
The **HTML/CSS Personal Website Project** demonstrates your ability to build a structured, visually appealing, and responsive web page using **HTML and CSS**.

## 🧱 Requirements

### 🧩 Content
- Write **three well-written paragraphs** about yourself.
- Include an **h1** title, an **h2** subtitle, and **three h3** section titles (one per paragraph).

### 🎨 HTML + CSS Structure
- Link the page to an **external stylesheet** named `styles.css`.
- Use the following **HTML elements**:
  - `<h1>`, `<h2>`, three `<h3>` headings  
  - three `<p>` paragraphs  
  - three `<img>` images (one per paragraph) with **wrapped text** (`float: left` or `float: right`)  
  - three `<a>` links to external sites, styled with `:link`, `:visited`, and `:hover`  
  - one outer `<div>` (e.g., `#container`) that defines page width  
  - one inner `<div>` for additional structure (e.g., `.sidebar` or `.info`)  
  - at least one **class rule** applied to each paragraph (e.g., `.bold`, `.highlight`, `.underline`)

### 🧾 CSS Requirements
- All styling must be in **`styles.css`** — no inline or internal CSS.
- Include CSS properties for:
  - `padding`, `margin`, `border`, `line-height`, and `font`
- Implement **three @media queries** for max-width breakpoints:
  - `1200px`, `992px`, and `768px`
- Style all links for interactivity using `:link`, `:visited`, and `:hover`.

### 🖼️ Design & Layout
- Use **sans-serif fonts** for readability.
- Choose harmonious colors using tools like [Coolors](https://coolors.co) or [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/).
- Center the main container using `margin-left` and `margin-right: auto`.
- Use **percentage-based widths** for responsive scaling.
- Consider removing floats or stacking columns on smaller screens.

## 💡 Helpful Tips
- Use resources such as [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) for syntax help.
- Optimize images before uploading; keep them under 1 MB each.
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography throughout your design.
- Keep your code organized and readable — indent properly and include comments.

## 🧠 File & Folder Structure

```
/images
  ├── photo1.jpg
  ├── photo2.png
  └── photo3.jpg
index.html
styles.css
README.md
images.md
```

📁 All images must be stored in the `/images` folder.  
See **[images.md](./images.md)** for details about acceptable formats and naming conventions.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design Guidelines
- Use **fixed widths** for large screens (e.g., 1100 px → 800 px → 700 px).
- For smaller screens, use **percentage widths** to make content fluid.
- Remove or adjust floats inside media queries for mobile layouts.
- Test your design on desktop, tablet, and mobile preview sizes.
